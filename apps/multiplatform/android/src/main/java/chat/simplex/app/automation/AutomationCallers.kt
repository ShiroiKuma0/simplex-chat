/**
 * Who is allowed through the automation door, and how that is decided.
 *
 * ## Why not a token
 *
 * The token this replaces was a 48-character secret 白い熊 pasted from one app's settings into
 * another's. It cannot survive a wipe, which is fatal for the case the whole family now exists to
 * serve: 応用管理 restoring apps and their data onto a clean phone, where nothing is configured yet.
 *
 * ## Why not a `shiroikuma.*` prefix
 *
 * Because that is not an identity. What makes [android.content.ContentProvider.getCallingPackage]
 * worth anything is that a package name **cannot be taken while the real package is installed** —
 * package names are not a namespace anyone owns, so any sideloaded app may call itself
 * `shiroikuma.evil` and pass a prefix test. Since the caller supplies the file descriptor an export
 * is written into, a prefix check would hand such an app the complete data of every sister app in
 * turn: strictly weaker than the token it replaces (応用管理, 2026-09-04, catching this in review).
 *
 * ## What is actually checked, in order
 *
 * 1. **An exact name** from [CALLERS]. Two callers exist and both are known here; a third is a
 *    one-line change.
 * 2. **The uid agrees.** `getCallingPackage()` reflects the caller's declared attribution, and
 *    packages sharing a uid are not distinguished by it, so it is confirmed against the uid the
 *    kernel reports.
 * 3. **The signing certificate matches a pinned hash.** This is the one that closes the real gap:
 *    *whichever caller package is absent from the device is a name anyone can take*, and the
 *    clean-phone case this contract exists for is precisely a device where not everything is
 *    installed yet — the moment the assumption is weakest is the moment it is most needed
 *    (白い熊, 2026-09-04, choosing to pin).

     * Every app in the family has **its own keystore** — 42 of them under `~/.android-keystores/` —
     * so there is no shared signing key to compare against and each caller must be pinned by name.
     * That is also why a `protectionLevel="signature"` permission was never an option here.
